This work presents visualization of different robotics path planning algorithms with in a customized 2D map. Currently includes A*, dijkstra, PRM, RRT and RSCurve algorithm. A map editor is included for creating user defined maps in GUI.

A short description and brief running time recording is available to illustrate simple performance evaluation for different algorithms with the map.
